    <h4>Being your own best friend can also be a great way to work through feelings of loneliness,
        insecurity, and instability in your life. By cultivating a productive and positive self, you can learn
        to trust yourself consistently and turn inward to work on any issues or problems you may
        encounter.</h4>

            <h3 style="background-color: azure; font-weight: 500;"> YOU LEARN HOW TO LOVE YOURSELF.</h3>
            <center><img src="Picture/LOVE YOURSELF.avif" alt="SELF LOVE"></center>
                <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Like we said before, most people have no earthly idea how to love themselves, or even like
                    themselves, because they can’t stand being alone. They would rather constantly escape
                    themselves than endure five minutes of sitting in silence with their own thoughts and feelings.
                    Many people spend their whole lives running away from themselves, just so they don’t have
                    to deal with what they find. However, uncovering both the darkness and light within will yield
                    beautiful new beginnings and discoveries about what you’re made of and who you are.
                    Once you start to become your own best friend, you will learn to treat yourself like you would
                    any other friend. You will also learn how to have a real relationship with yourself, and not
                    depend on others for love and attention.</p>

        <article class="post2">
            <h3 style="background-color: azure;"> SOLITUDE WON’T SCARE YOU ANYMORE.</h3>
            <center><img src="Picture/SOLITUDE.avif" alt="BE YOURSELF"></center>
                <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Many people feel afraid of the idea of spending time alone, but it shouldn’t scare you; in fact,
                    it should liberate you. You don’t have to answer to anyone else or try to explain yourself to
                    others; you can just BE, and take in the joy of simply being alive. In solitude, you can find out
                    more about yourself, and do things on your own clock. If you want to spend hours in nature,
                    go do that. If you want to spend time gardening, drawing, or coloring, go do it. Spending time
                    alone means learning what you like and don’t like, which will help you uncover more truths
                    about yourself and peel back those layers you have on your soul.</p>

            <h3 style="background-color: azure;">ALL YOUR RELATIONSHIPS WILL IMPROVE.</h3>
             <center><img src="Picture/RELATIONSHIP.webp" alt="RELATIONSHIPS"></center>
                <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Once you become your own best friend, you will magically see all the other relationships in
                    your life improve. You will no longer have disconnected or strained relationships, because you
                    will have started to mend everything disjointed and distant within yourself. If you want better,
                    more meaningful relationships in your life, you must first learn how to be your best friend and
                    love yourself no matter what. Do this, and you will have blossoming, wonderful relationships
                    with others that seem effortless rather than exhausting.</p>

        <article class="post4">
            <h3 style="background-color: azure;">BEING YOUR OWN BEST FRIEND MEANS CREATING YOUR
                OWN HAPPINESS.</h3>
                <center><img src="Picture/BESTFRIEND.avif" alt="HAPPINESS"></center>
                <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">As you make a best friend out of yourself, it will become clear that nothing outside you should
                    regulate your happiness. You hold the reigns, and you can gallop through the most beautiful
                    field of wildflowers, or into the darkest, stormiest night. You get to make the choice, and only
                    you can steer yourself toward a happier life. In becoming your own best friend, you will learn
                    what makes you happy, and start doing more of that! We can’t learn to create our own
                    happiness if we don’t take the time to explore ourselves and realize what brings our hearts the
                    most joy.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="post5">
            <h3 style="background-color: azure;">YOU WILL FEEL MORE INDEPENDENT.</h3>
            <center><img src="Picture/INDEPENDENT.avif" alt="BELIEVE"></center>
                <p style="font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; font-size: medium;">Nothing feels better than freeing yourself from expectations and dependency on others. Simply
                    put, if you rely solely on other people for happiness, companionship, safety, or anything else,
                    you will have NOTHING when they leave. You must cultivate all of this within yourself and
                    truly realize that everything you need, you already have. You came to this Earth as a divinely
                    created, complete being, so nothing is lacking within you. This world might have you think you
                    need all these things outside yourself to feel happy, but don’t buy into that. You have it all, and
                    once you understand this and choose to live from a belief of abundance rather than scarcity
                    or inadequacy, you will have the best friend possible by your side: yourself.</p>
